# BIFS
**Bayesian Image Analysis in Fourier Space**

BIFS is a framework and set of computational tools for implementation of Bayesian Image analysis in Fourier Space. The BIFS approach enables enhanced feature contrast and noise reduction, analogous to, but much more efficiently than Bayesian methods applied directly in image space, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. This efficiency is provided by the fact that for a large class of images the Fourier modes can reasonably be approximated as being independent, thus reducing the optimization problem from one involving a large number of coupled variables to one involving a product of independent one dimensional optimizations. BIFS is useful for a large class of images and in particular for medical imaging problems, including clinical imaging studies, screening, diagnosis, and treatment evaluation.
