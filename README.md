# BIFS
Bayesian Image Analysis in Fourier Space

Bifs is a framework - along with the computational tools - for imaging practitioners to easily implement their own Bayesian Image analysis in Fourier Space class of models. The BIFS approach will efficiently enable enhanced feature contrast and reduced image noise in a wide range of medical imaging problems, including clinical imaging studies, screening, diagnosis, and treatment evaluation.

The goal is to develop, implement, and disseminate a new approach to medical image processing that,
* leads to enhanced images beyond conventional standards
* allows straightforward specification and implementation across a wide range of medical imaging research and clinical practice problems 
* is amenable to fast and high-throughput processing

In addition, we hope this framework and these methods will find application in many other image processing applications.
