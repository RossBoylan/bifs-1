# BIFS
**Bayesian Image Analysis in Fourier Space**

BIFS is a framework and set of computational tools for implementation of Bayesian Image analysis in Fourier Space. The BIFS approach enables enhanced feature contrast and noise reduction, analogous to, but more efficient than Bayesian image analysis methods applied directly in image space. This efficiency is provided by the fact that for a large class of spatially correlated process in the space of images, the Fourier modes can reasonably be approximated as being independent. The independence approximation reduces the optimization problem from a high-dimensional problem to one involving a product of low-dimensional optimizations. BIFS is useful for a large class of images and in particular for medical imaging problems, including clinical imaging studies, screening, diagnosis, and treatment evaluation.
